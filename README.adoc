# Quality-Education-SDG

The purpose of your final project is to show what you have learned over the past semester. Your final project will count for 30% of your final mark. You will work in groups of 3 or 4, marked individually based on your contribution. Keep in mind that each group member must fulfill the requirements of the rubric individually. Your project will be to address the Quality Education Sustainable Development Goal in an app or game of your choice.
